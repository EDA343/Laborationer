  DNS is used to fetch the IP-address of the given hostname for a web server.
  A request by the host is sent to the DNS-server, and the server hopefully
  responds with the IP-address of the website.

  TCP is responsible for making the transfer of data between two end-points
  in a secure and reliable fashion. It is also responsible for delivering
  the right data to the right application upon completed transfer.

  HTTP uses TCP to send the web content of the web site to the host. The
  content (which usually is in HTML-format) is then interpreted by a web
  reader.

2:
  The HTTP GET message was sent at 52.884s, according to Wireshark's
  measurements, and the HTTP OK message was received at 53.033s.
  That yields the difference 53.033s - 52.884s and thus it took 149ms.

3:
  If we take a look in the GET message, we can see two IP-addresses, source
  and destination. The source in this case is the host, since the host
  is the one requesting to the server, which then would be the destination.
  The host IP is then 192.168.43.219, and the server IP 128.119.245.12.

  As partly seen in the Mac OSX terminal (the format of the answer has
  been shortened and rearranged to display what we want to see):

  $ ifconfig

  $ nslookup www.masalakitchen.se
  Server:		192.168.43.1
  Address:	192.168.43.1#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  www.masalakitchen.se	canonical name = masalakitchen.se.
  Name:	masalakitchen.se
  Address: 109.74.1.223

  $ nslookup -type=NS www.masalakitchen.se
  Server:		192.168.43.1
  Address:	192.168.43.1#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  www.masalakitchen.se	canonical name = masalakitchen.se.
  masalakitchen.se	nameserver = ns1.smsgruppen.com.
  masalakitchen.se	nameserver = ns2.smsgruppen.com.
