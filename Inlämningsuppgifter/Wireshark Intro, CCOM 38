  DNS is used to fetch the IP-address of the given hostname for a web server.
  A request by the host is sent to the DNS-server, and the server hopefully
  responds with the IP-address of the website.

  TCP is responsible for making the transfer of data between two end-points
  in a secure and reliable fashion. It is also responsible for delivering
  the right data to the right application upon completed transfer.

  HTTP uses TCP to send the web content of the web site to the host. The
  content (which usually is in HTML-format) is then interpreted by a web
  reader.

2:
  The HTTP GET message was sent at 52.884s, according to Wireshark's
  measurements, and the HTTP OK message was received at 53.033s.
  That yields the difference 53.033s - 52.884s and thus it took 149ms.

3:
  If we take a look in the GET message, we can see two IP-addresses, source
  and destination. The source in this case is the host, since the host
  is the one requesting to the server, which then would be the destination.
  The host IP is then 192.168.43.219, and the server IP 128.119.245.12.

  As partly seen in the Mac OSX terminal and Windows command window,
  repectively (the format of the answers have been shortened and
  rearranged, to display only what we want to see):

  The command "ipconfig /displaydns" in Windows is used to display all the cached
  domain names stored on the computer. Each entry has a timer that determines how
  long the entry remains in the cache. It's useful to see which web servers the
  host most recently has visited.
  
  If the host for some reason wants to clear the cahce, the "ipconfig /flushdns"
  command can be used. It will delete each and every entry in the cache. This
  is useful if the host wants to "restart" a web session.
