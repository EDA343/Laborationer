Task 1)
  a)
    When running the 'ifconfig' command (in Mac OSX/Unix), you get all
    information about the different interfaces at the host computer. We want
    to look at the "Ethernet 0" (en0) interface, which is configured with the
    IP information we need:

        $ ifconfig

        <output omitted>

        en0:  flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
    	        ether 20:c9:d0:7f:0f:25
    	        inet6 fe80::22c9:d0ff:fe7f:f25%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4
              inet 129.16.182.106 netmask 0xfffff000 broadcast 129.16.191.255
            	nd6 options=1<PERFORMNUD>
            	media: autoselect
            	status: active

        <output omitted>

    The 'inet' field shows information about the IPv4 configuration for that
    interface. The global unicast IP-address is then "129.16.182.106/20". The
    broadcast address for this network is "129.16.191.255/20".

  b)
    The hostname can be found using the 'nslookup' command on the IP-address
    obtained in the previous task:

        $ nslookup 129.16.182.106

        Server:		129.16.1.53
        Address:	129.16.1.53#53

        Non-authoritative answer:
        106.182.16.129.in-addr.arpa	name = dhcp-182106.eduroam.chalmers.se.

        <output omitted>

    The answer is given by the non-authorative name server
    "106.182.16.129.in-addr.arpa", which is a locally stored version of the
    hostname/IP-address entry. The hostname that was given is then
    "dhcp-182106.eduroam.chalmers.se".

Task 2)
  a)
    We can trace a packet route over the internet by using the 'traceroute'
    command:

  b)
    'traceroute', as the name suggests, traces the route of an IP-packet over
    the internet. It is implemented using the "User Datagram Protocol" (UDP),
    to transport the packet from the host computer to a specified destination.
    The reason UDP is used over the more reliable "Transmission Control
    Protocol" (TCP) is that UDP maintains the route for all packets that it
    sends, which is essential in order for 'traceroute' to work.

    'traceroute' initially sets the 'Time To Live' value to 1 in the IP-header.
    Then after every three packets it sends, the TTL value increments by one.
    When the first router then receives the first packet, it will decrement the
    TTL value by 1, resulting in a value of 0. This means that the packet can
    not be forwarded any further and an "Internet Control Message Protocol"
    (ICMP) message is generated. This message goes all the way back to the
    source. In the mean time, 'traceroute' have started counting the time from
    when a packet is being sent to when the ICMP message for that packet is
    received. Then the second package is sent and when a reply is received, the
    third packet is sent. When the reply for that packet has been received, the
    TTL value becomes 2. When the fourth packet then arrives at the first
    router on the way, TTL becomes 1 and the packet is forwarded to the next
    router. That router then does the same thing and generates an ICMP message
    that goes back to the source. This is repeated until the TTL is large
    enough to reach the destination. This way we can put together a table of
    three roundtrip times for each node on the route.
