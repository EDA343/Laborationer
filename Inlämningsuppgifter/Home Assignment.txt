Task 1)
  a)
    When running the 'ifconfig' command (in Mac OSX/Unix), you get all
    information about the different interfaces at the host computer. We want
    to look at the "Ethernet 0" (en0) interface, which is configured with the
    IP information we need:

        $ ifconfig

        <output omitted>

        en0:  flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
    	        ether 20:c9:d0:7f:0f:25
    	        inet6 fe80::22c9:d0ff:fe7f:f25%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4
              inet 129.16.182.106 netmask 0xfffff000 broadcast 129.16.191.255
            	nd6 options=1<PERFORMNUD>
            	media: autoselect
            	status: active

        <output omitted>

    The 'inet' field shows information about the IPv4 configuration for that
    interface. The global unicast IP-address is then "129.16.182.106/20". The
    broadcast address for this network is "129.16.191.255/20".

  b)
    The hostname can be found using the 'nslookup' command on the IP-address
    obtained in the previous task:

        $ nslookup 129.16.182.106

        Server:		129.16.1.53
        Address:	129.16.1.53#53

        Non-authoritative answer:
        106.182.16.129.in-addr.arpa	name = dhcp-182106.eduroam.chalmers.se.

        <output omitted>

    The answer is given by the non-authorative name server
    "106.182.16.129.in-addr.arpa", which is a locally stored version of the
    hostname/IP-address entry. The hostname that was given is then
    "dhcp-182106.eduroam.chalmers.se".

Task 2)
  a)
    We can trace a packet route over the internet by using the 'traceroute'
    command:

  b)
    'traceroute', as the name suggests, traces the route of an IP-packet over
    the internet. It is implemented using the "User Datagram Protocol" (UDP),
    to transport the packet from the host computer to a specified destination.
    The reason UDP is used over the more reliable "Transmission Control
    Protocol" (TCP) is that UDP maintains the route for all packets that it
    sends, which is essential in order for 'traceroute' to work.

    'traceroute' initially sets the 'Time To Live' value to 1 in the IP-header.
    Then after every three packets it sends, the TTL value increments by one.
    When the first router then receives the first packet, it will decrement the
    TTL value by 1, resulting in a value of 0. This means that the packet can
    not be forwarded any further and an "Internet Control Message Protocol"
    (ICMP) message is generated. This message goes all the way back to the
    source. In the mean time, 'traceroute' have started counting the time from
    when a packet is being sent to when the ICMP message for that packet is
    received. Then the second package is sent and when a reply is received, the
    third packet is sent. When the reply for that packet has been received, the
    TTL value becomes 2. When the fourth packet then arrives at the first
    router on the way, TTL becomes 1 and the packet is forwarded to the next
    router. That router then does the same thing and generates an ICMP message
    that goes back to the source. This is repeated until the TTL is large
    enough to reach the destination. This way we can put together a table of
    three roundtrip times for each node on the route.

	The type of web server www.chalmers.se is using is "Microsoft-IIS/7.5".
	We get the response 401 Unauthorized, which means that we do not have access
	to URL resources without providing user authentication (log in somewhere with a username and a password). The authentication protocol in this case, which is specified in the WWW-Authenticate field of the HTTP header, is NTLM.

	Content-Length is the size of the content that is being sent, in octets(bytes).
	Content-Type indicates what type of media is being sent. 
	SPRequestGuid contains diagnostic information about server problems.
	X-SharePointHealthScore is a number between 0 and 10 where 0 indicates low server load and 10 indicates high server load.
	X-Powered-By specifies which technology is used to support the web application.
	MicrosoftSharePointTeamServices indicates which version of Microsoft SharePoint is installed.
	X-MS-InvokeApp specifies if the application wants to use DirectInvoke, which lets a user open for example a PDF without first saving it to their computer. RequiredReadOnly means that it opens in Read-Only mode.

	www.tue.nl is using the web server type "Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)".
	301 Move Permanently means that the resource we are requesting has been redirected tot a new URL. The new URL is specified in the Location field. In this case www.tue.nl is redirecting to http://www.tue.nl/. 
	The Vary field specifies which fields of the request header to take into account when trying to find the right object in the cache.

	In an HTTP 1.1 request you have to specify the name of the host of the resource you are requesting. You can also specify a port number, but we did not do that since it defaults to 80 if you do not specify one. If we do not include a host name in the request, the server responds with 400 Bad Request, as we saw in 4b.

	Say for example that we are hosting several different websites on a single machine. They all share an IP address. To be able to send the request to the correct website, we need to specify a host name. This is what the host header field is used for; differentiating between multiple hosts on the same IP.
