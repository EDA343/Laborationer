\begin{enumerate}[{Task} 1]
\item :
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item 
When running the {\outp ifconfig} command (in Mac OSX/Unix), you get all the
information about the different interfaces at the host computer. Running the
command in a home network, we get the following information
about the {\outp Ethernet0} (en0) interface:
			
\begin{lstlisting}
$ ifconfig

<output omitted>

en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
		 ether 20:c9:d0:7f:0f:25
		 inet6 fe80::22c9:d0ff:fe7f:f25\%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4
		 inet 192.168.1.119 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
		 nd6 options=1<PERFORMNUD>
		 media: autoselect
		 status: active

<output omitted>
\end{lstlisting}

The {\outp inet} field shows information about the IPv4 configuration for that
interface. The unicast IP-address is then {\outp 129.16.182.106/20} and the
broadcast address for this network is {\outp 129.16.191.255/20}. However, the
IP-address is within the private address space, so the router has to
convert it into a globally unique IP-address using {\it Network Address
Translation} (NAT). This address is provided to the router by the {\it Internet
Service Provider} (ISP), and all traffic in the local network going out
from the router will then use this address to communicate through the
Internet.
    
\item 
The hostname can be found using the {\outp nslookup} command on the IP-address
obtained in the previous task:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ nslookup 192.168.1.1

Server:		192.168.1.1
Address:	192.168.1.1#53

119.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa	name = Hampus-MBP.huawei.com.
\end{lstlisting}

The answer is given by the name server {\outp 119.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa}. The
hostname that was given is {\outp Hampus-MBP.huawei.com}.

	The type of web server www.chalmers.se is using is "Microsoft-IIS/7.5".
	We get the response 401 Unauthorized, which means that we do not have access
	to URL resources without providing user authentication (log in somewhere with a username and a password). The authentication protocol in this case, which is specified in the WWW-Authenticate field of the HTTP header, is NTLM.

	Content-Length is the size of the content that is being sent, in octets(bytes).
	Content-Type indicates what type of media is being sent.
	SPRequestGuid contains diagnostic information about server problems.
	X-SharePointHealthScore is a number between 0 and 10 where 0 indicates low server load and 10 indicates high server load.
	X-Powered-By specifies which technology is used to support the web application.
	MicrosoftSharePointTeamServices indicates which version of Microsoft SharePoint is installed.
	X-MS-InvokeApp specifies if the application wants to use DirectInvoke, which lets a user open for example a PDF without first saving it to their computer. RequiredReadOnly means that it opens in Read-Only mode.

	www.tue.nl is using the web server type "Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)".
	301 Move Permanently means that the resource we are requesting has been redirected tot a new URL. The new URL is specified in the Location field. In this case www.tue.nl is redirecting to http://www.tue.nl/.
	The Vary field specifies which fields of the request header to take into account when trying to find the right object in the cache.

	In an HTTP 1.1 request you have to specify the name of the host of the resource you are requesting. You can also specify a port number, but we did not do that since it defaults to 80 if you do not specify one. If we do not include a host name in the request, the server responds with 400 Bad Request, as we saw in 4b.

	Say for example that we are hosting several different websites on a single machine. They all share an IP address. To be able to send the request to the correct website, we need to specify a host name. This is what the host header field is used for; differentiating between multiple hosts on the same IP.

The "nslookup" command can be used to find information about the DNS servers of a domain.

	We will use utoronto.ca (University of Toronto) for this task. 
	Here are the results of our nslookup for utoronto.ca:

	>nslookup -type=mx utoronto.ca
	Server:  res1.chalmers.se
	Address:  129.16.1.53

	Non-authoritative answer:
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = k.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = d.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = b.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = c.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = g.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = a.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = l.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = e.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = f.mx.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = j.mx.utoronto.ca

	utoronto.ca     nameserver = bay.cs.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     nameserver = ns2.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     nameserver = ns1.utoronto.ca
	utoronto.ca     nameserver = ns7.utoronto.ca
	bay.cs.utoronto.ca      internet address = 128.100.1.1
	ns1.utoronto.ca internet address = 128.100.100.129
	ns2.utoronto.ca internet address = 128.100.72.168
	ns7.utoronto.ca internet address = 162.243.71.42

	
	To find the mail servers we set the type parameter to MX(Mail eXchange).
	We find that there are 10 mail servers for utoronto.ca, with all of them having equal priority (preference = 10). All of them having equal priority means that we do not care which of the mail servers we use first. 

	We also find the DNS servers and their respective IP addresses. 
\item 
We use www.google.com for this task.

	>nslookup www.google.com
	Server:  	res1.chalmers.se
	Address:  	129.16.1.53

	Non-authoritative answer:
	Name:    	www.google.com
	Addresses:  2a00:1450:4010:c02::68
          		74.125.205.106
          		74.125.205.103
          		74.125.205.105
          		74.125.205.99
          		74.125.205.147
          		74.125.205.104

    We can see that www.google.com has 6 different IP addresses. Multiple IP addresses can be used to balance load between web servers. There can be several copies of the same web site, each having its own IP address but all using the same DNS servers. The first user who sends a request is sent to the first IP address, the second person to the second IP address and so on. This reduces the amount of requests to each web server and provides redundancy in case a web server should go down.s

    Multiple IP addresses can also be used to have different IP addresses for different services.
